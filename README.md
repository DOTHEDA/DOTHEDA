Hi, I'm Vivian. I love programming in obscure languages and making whacky one-off programs as well as programming old machines (like the Commodore 64 and DOS.)
Hoping I can fill some empty niches in due time.

I'm really into the programming languages Nim, C, FreePascal and FreeBASIC/QB64.
I'm also into embedded programming such as AVR (Arduino), STM8/STM32, ESP32, etc.
